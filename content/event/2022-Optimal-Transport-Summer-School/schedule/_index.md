**Particle method for the Landau equation — A gradient flow perspective**: The Landau equation is an important partial differential equation in kinetic theory. It describes the charged particle collisions and can be    formally derived as a limit of the Boltzmann equation when all collisions become grazing. In this work, we propose a new perspective of the Landau equation inspired by its analogy with the heat equation and the Wasserstein-2 gradient flow of the Boltzmann entropy. Based on this formulation, we develop a deterministic particle method for the Landau equation which preserves important physical properties such as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy and entropy decay. Finally, we discuss some ongoing work to integrate the proposed method to the popular Particle-In-Cell method in solving the Vlasov-Landau equation in plasma physics.

#### Saturday, June 25

  * **Group Trip to Alki Beach.**
  {{< detail-tag "Show details" >}}
  (depending on the weather) We will go to the iconic Seattle [Alki beach](https://goo.gl/maps/ifTTExRMtqKqLGpE8) by the Puget sound. We will take the light rail from the university to the [Pioneer square station](https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/stops-stations/pioneer-square-station) and then walk to the [Pier 50 dock](https://goo.gl/maps/QbNgnxtyAnSsL77M8) to take the [West Seattle water taxi](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/water-taxi/west-seattle.aspx) to go across the sound and then walk to the beach. There are plenty of entertainment opportunities. One can rent kayaks, bike, play beach volleyball, or just relax and enjoy the fantastic views of the Olympic mountains and the Seattle skyline. Details TBA.

  **Two Short Stories about Optimal Transport**: I will tell two short stories. One is a recent
application of Optimal Transport in Potential Theory
(particularly the problem of minimizing Riesz energy).
The second, joint with Bamdad Hosseini, is a fun
observation that Kantorovich solutions mapping discrete
measures to other discrete measures are intrinsically
sparse (with sparsity depending on number-theoretic
properties of the two measures).

  **Identification and Estimation of Treatment Effects in the Limited Overlap Region**:  Strong ignorability is a commonly used assumption to identify average treatment effects based on observational data. It is often argued that the conditional independence assumption can be made more plausible by using more covariates. However using more covariates makes the overlapping assumption less likely to hold. In most empirical applications, the supports of distributions of the covariate vector for different groups do not fully overlap or have limited overlap. Without imposing additional assumptions on the limited or no overlap region, average treatment effects for either the limited overlap region or for the whole population are not point identified.  

In this talk, we make a natural domain shift assumption for the limited overlap region based on optimal transport theory. We study identification of average treatment effects for the limited overlap region and propose three-step estimators of the average treatment effect and quantile treatment effect for the treated in the limited overlap region. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators under high level assumptions on the estimator of the optimal transport map. Three examples of the estimator of the optimal transport map are studied in detail and are shown to satisfy the high level assumptions under primitive conditions. We investigate the finite sample performance of our estimator and Wald inference via simulation.
