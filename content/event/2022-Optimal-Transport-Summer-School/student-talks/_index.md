The Landau equation is an important partial differential equation in kinetic
theory. It describes the charged particle collisions and can be formally derived
as a limit of the Boltzmann equation when all collisions become grazing. In this
work, we propose a new perspective of the Landau equation inspired by its
analogy with the heat equation and the Wasserstein-2 gradient flow of the
Boltzmann entropy. Based on this formulation, we develop a deterministic
particle method for the Landau equation which preserves important physical
properties such as conservation and entropy decay. Finally, we discuss some
ongoing work to integrate the proposed method to the popular Particle-In-Cell
method in solving the Vlasov-Landau equation in plasma physics.
