title: "PIMS- IFDS- NSF Summer School on Optimal Transport"
event: "PIMS- IFDS- NSF Summer School on Optimal Transport"
subtitle: ""
location: University of Washington, Seattle

summary: |
 The common theme of this summer school is the mathematics of Monge-Kantorovich
 optimal transport (OT). The stunning mathematical development of OT has
 recently permeated into several fields of applications. Our speakers, chosen
 from the fields of analysis, biology, data science, economics, and probability,
 are leaders in their respective fields whose work intimately involves OT. Our
 goal is to expose talented students and junior researchers to the exciting and
 manifold research opportunities arising from OT and its applications, through
 attending lectures and interacting with the speakers as well as their peer
 participants. We strongly encourage participation by a diverse audience and
 welcome attendees from traditionally underrepresented socio-economic and
 cultural groups.

 As the school is planned at the beginning of the summer season in Seattle, the
 participants can also enjoy the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest and
 feel the energy of one of leading tech metropolises in the United States and
 around the world.

## Summer School in Optimal Transport

The common theme of this summer school is the mathematics of Monge-Kantorovich
optimal transport (OT). The stunning mathematical development of OT has recently
permeated into several fields of applications. Our speakers, chosen from the
fields of analysis, biology, data science, economics, and probability, are
leaders in their respective fields whose work intimately involves OT. Our goal
is to expose talented students and junior researchers to the exciting and
manifold research opportunities arising from OT and its applications, through
attending lectures and interacting with the speakers as well as their peer
participants. We strongly encourage participation by a diverse audience and
welcome attendees from traditionally underrepresented socio-economic and
cultural groups.

As the school is planned at the beginning of the summer season in Seattle, the
participants can also enjoy the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest and feel
the energy of one of leading tech metropolises in the United States and around
the world.

## Main Speakers
  * Felix Otto (Max Planck Institute, Germany)
  * Inwon Kim (UCLA, USA)
  * Maria Colombo (EPFL, Switzerland)
  * Jan Maas (IST, Austria)
  * Alfred Galichon (NYU, USA)
  * Geoffrey Schiebinger (UBC, Canada)
  * Gabriel Peyr√© (ENS, France).
