## Getting to UW
All lectures will take place at the University of Washington's [Johnson Hall,
room 102](http://uw.edu/maps/?jhn). The UW [getting here
page](https://transportation.uw.edu/getting-here/transit) has up to date
information on getting to campus and finding your way around once you get here. The [UW Visitor
center](https://www.washington.edu/visit/) also has a lot of relevant information on UW and Seattle.

Information about parking near the campus can be found [here](https://transportation.uw.edu/park).

## Safety
Although, in general, Seattle is a very safe city, it is still important to pay attention to your surroundings, especially if you are alone and walking 
late at night. Here are some tips to remain safe during your stay. Travel in groups if you are venturing outside the campus late at night. If you are close 
to campus and feel unsafe at night, 
please call [Husky Nightwalk](https://police.uw.edu/services/safetyescortservices/) at 206.685.9255 to ask for a uniformed guard who will escort you back 
to your accommodation. If you are a victim of a crime, please call the emergency number 911 from any phone. For any non-emergencies, call the campus police 
at 206.685.8973. The phones on campus are free if you call 
emergency. If you are using the Seattle Light rail late at night, please use the University of Washington Stadium station instead of the U-district 
station. Avoid any confrontation with strangers on the streets.
