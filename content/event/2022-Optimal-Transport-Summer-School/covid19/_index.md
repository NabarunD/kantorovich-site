COVID 19 is still with us and a possibility of an outbreak during our summer school must be taken seriously. 
Please pay close attention to the following information and protocol before and during the event in order to minimize risk. 

We ask ALL our attendees (US and international) to get tested for COVID 19 72 hours prior to their travel to Seattle or, if they are local, prior to the first day of the school. A PCR test is prefered. 

All attendees must be fully vaccinated against COVID 19 to attended. This means two shots of an [approved vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/people-vaccinated-abroad.html). An additional booster shot is strongly encouraged. Vaccination requirements for the University of WA can be found [here](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/vaccination-requirement/). 

The University of WA [strongly recommends](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/covid-19-prevention-and-response/face-covering-policy) wearing a well-fitted, high-quality mask indoors (e.g., KN95, N95, KF94 and surgical masks) to reduce the potential for transmission. These types of masks are available for free in [several locations](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/2022/01/27/where-to-pick-up-free-high-quality-masks-starting-jan-31/) on the campus.

We also encourage you to [download](https://doh.wa.gov/emergencies/covid-19/wa-notify) WA notify app on your phone. WA Notify (also known as Washington Exposure Notifications) is a free tool that works on smartphones to alert users if they may have been exposed to COVID-19 without sharing any personal information. It is completely private and doesn't know who you are or track where you go. 


During your stay if you feel unwell get tested immediately. Testing resources for students and visitors can be found [here](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/student-faq/#testloc). The closest location near campus is the UW medicine [testing facility](https://goo.gl/maps/wpRVwHzLtUPTohyr6) in the U-district which is about 15 minutes walk. Sun-Fri 9 a.m. - 5:30 p.m.  It is a walk-in site although appointments are encouraged. You may call them at 833.562.1212 for more information.  

You can also get tested or get home testing kit at local pharmacies such as CVS and Safeway. The cost per test/kit is 99 USD. 

If your test comes back positive, immediately let the organizers know and isolate yourself. If you have been given accommodation by us, there are special quarantine rooms where you will be kept. You must also report to the organizers a list of close contacts in the last few days so that we can notify them. We will not divulge your name or personal information.
