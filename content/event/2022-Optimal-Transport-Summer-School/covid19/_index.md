COVID 19 is still with us and a possibility of an outbreak during our summer school must be taken seriously. 
Please pay close attention to the following information and protocol before and during the event in order to minimize risk. 

We ask ALL our attendees (US and international) to get tested for COVID 19 72 hours prior to their travel. A PCR test is prefered. 

All attendees must be fully vaccinated against COVID 19 to attended. This means two shots of an approved vaccine. An additional booster shot is strongly encouraged. Vaccination requirements for the University of WA can be found [here](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/vaccination-requirement/). 


During your stay if you feel unwell get tested immediately. Testing resources for students and visitors can be found [here](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/).

If your test comes back positive, immediately let the organizers know and isolate yourself. If you have been given accommodation by us, there are special isolation rooms where you will be kept. You must also report to the organizers a list of close contacts in the last few days so that we can notify them. We will not divulge your name or personal information.
