What is optimal transport (OT)? At its heart it is a simple optimization problem.

This course has two main objectives: first, to introduce a wide range of students
to the exciting and broadly applicable research area of optimal transport, and
second, to explore more closely its applications in a particular field, which
will vary from year to year.  Optimal transport is the general problem of moving
one distribution of mass to another as efficiently as possible (for example,
think of using a pile of dirt to fill a hole of the same volume, so as to
minimize the average distance moved).  This basic problem has a wealth of
applications within mathematics (in PDE, geometry, functional analysis,
probability...) as well as in other fields (comparing images in image
processing, comparing and interpolating between data sets in statistics,
matching partners in economics, aligning electrons in chemical physics...) and
is currently an extremely active research area.
