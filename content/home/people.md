  We are inspired by the works of mathematician and economist [Leonid
  Kantorovich](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Kantorovich-Leonid-V)
  who is considered one of the fathers of modern theory of linear programming and of optimal mass transport. Kantorovich was interested in the economic aspects and application of his work, for which he won the Nobel prize in economics in 1975.

  The current activities of KI are being supported by grants from the [Pacific
