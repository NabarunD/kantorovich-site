  Kantorovich](https://www.informs.org/Explore/History-of-O.R.-Excellence/Biographical-Profiles/Kantorovich-Leonid-V)
  who is considered one of the fathers of modern theory of mass transport and a
  winner of the Nobel prize in economics.

  The current activities of KI are being supported by grants from the [Pacific
  Institute for the Mathematical Sciences](https://www.pims.math.ca) and the
