The mathematics of optimal transport (OT) has grown to become a unifying theme
in many scientific disciplines, from solving purely mathematical problems of
analysis, geometry, and partial differential equations to developing
revolutionary new methods in economics, statistics, machine learning and
artificial intelligence. In the last decade, the impact of optimal transport in
the study of geometry was highlighted by two Fields medals (Villani 2010,
Figalli 2018). On the other hand, OT has established itself as a viable
alternative to classical maximum likelihood based methods in statistics and data
science. Other notable applications include generative adversarial network (GAN)
in machine learning (Wasserstein GAN), new applications to stem cell biology,
and economic applications such as generalizations of the Nobel prize winning
Gale-Shapley algorithm, online auctions, and option pricing.

Much of these recent advances are due to remarkable leaps in computational
methods in OT that hinge on entropy based regularizations. Optimal transport, as
an optimization problem, is expensive to compute. The entropy regularized
version of the same problem finds near-optimal solutions at so-called
lightning-fast speed. Not only has this transformed the scope of applications,
but the theory of entropy-regularized optimal transport has made important
contributions in theoretical probability, statistical physics, and other areas
of pure mathematics and engineering. With this breadth of theory and
applications comes the challenge of organizing the different groups of
researchers to allow an exchange of their most recent problems and results. Our
proposed BIRS meeting is aimed squarely at bringing together the disparate
groups working on entropic regularizations of OT problems, irrespective of their
home field. Special consideration is being given towards training younger
researchers and students by exposing them to different aspects of theory and
giving them opportunities for possible cross-disciplinary collaborations.

The Banff International Research Station for Mathematical Innovation and
Discovery (BIRS) is a collaborative Canada-US-Mexico venture that provides an
environment for creative interaction as well as the exchange of ideas,
knowledge, and methods within the Mathematical Sciences, with related
disciplines and with industry. The research station is located at The Banff
Centre in Alberta and is supported by Canada's Natural Science and Engineering
Research Council (NSERC), the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), Alberta's
Advanced Education and Technology, and Mexico's Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y
Tecnolog√≠a (CONACYT).
