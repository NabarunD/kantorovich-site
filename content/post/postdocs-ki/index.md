### Kantorovich Initiative Inaugural Postdoc Position

The Kantorovich Initiative (KI) invites applications for its inaugural
postdoctoral position. KI is an interdisciplinary collaborative research group
focusing on the mathematics of optimal transport and its applications to
different branches of mathematics, biology, economics, engineering, statistics
and data science. See Kantorovich.org.

This is a one year position, renewable for a second year subject to satisfactory
performance. The location can be either at the University of Alberta, Edmonton,
or at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. The final decision will be
determined between the successful candidate and the selection committee. The
start date is September 1, 2022, although there is some flexibility to
accommodate the successful candidate's schedule.

The ideal candidate is a mathematically talented and original researcher, with
interests varying from analysis and probability to optimization and discrete
mathematics. The candidate should have a strong background in the mathematics of
optimal transport, a keen interest in applications, and an aptitude for learning
about related new fields.

Applications should be submitted <a target="_blank"

details can be found. For further questions, please contact <a

### Mathematical Foundations of Biological Data Analysis - UBC Postdoc Position
We are looking to hire several postdoctoral fellows to work on mathematical
foundations of biological data analysis.

New measurement technologies like single-cell RNA sequencing are bringing 'big
data' to biology. Our group develops new mathematical techniques that help bring
new measurement technologies to their full potential. Current projects relate to
analysis of single cell RNA-seq time-courses with thousands of time-points and
to large-scale spatial transcriptomics datasets.

We aim to develop a mathematical theory to answer questions like How does a stem
cell transform into a muscle cell, a skin cell, or a neuron? How can we
reprogram a skin cell into a neuron?

Funding for these positions is available for 2 years, renewable up to 4. To
apply, please submit an <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/18079"
target="_blank">application on MathJobs</a> and also alert <a
