  Consider the problem of finding the optimal coupling (or matching) between two
  i.i.d. samples from respective two densities on Euclidean spaces. For both
  computational efficiency and smoothness, this discrete problem is usually
  regularized by an entropy term. We introduce a modification to the commonly used
  discrete entropic regularization [Cuturi ('13)] so that the optimal coupling of
  the regularized problem can be viewed as the static Schroedinger bridge given a
  finite number of particles. We show that this discrete Schroedinger bridge
  converges weakly to its continuum counterpart as the sample size goes to
  infinity. The proofs are based on a change of measure argument equipped with a
  novel contiguity result on the sequence of laws of the pair of empirical
  measures. We derive a functional CLT and second order Gaussian chaos limits when
  the limiting Gaussian is degenerate. This is achieved by a new chaos
  decomposition for paired samples using Markov operators. This idea generalizes
  the Hoeffding decomposition from the classical U-statistics theory, where the
  samples are assumed to be independent. This talk is based on joint work with
  Zaid Harchaoui and Soumik Pal.
