abstract: |
  Suppose you want to open up 7 coffee shops so that people in the
downtown area have to walk the least amount to get their morning coffee.  
That's a classical problem in Optimal Transport, minimizing the Wasserstein 
distance between the sum of 7 Dirac measures and the (coffee-drinking) 
population density. But in reality things are trickier. If the 7 coffee shops go well, 
you want to open an 8th and a 9th and you want to remain optimal in this respect 
(and the first 7 are already fixed). We find optimal rates for this problem in W2 
in all dimensions. Analytic Number Theory makes an appearance and, in fact, 
Optimal Transport can tell us something new about sqrt(2).  All of this is also 
related to the question of approximating an integral by sampling in a number of 
points and a conjectured extension of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality regarding
the W1 distance and testing of two measures against Lipschitz functions.
