abstract: |
  The initial value problem for many
  important PDEs (Burgers, Euler, Hamilton-Jacobi, Navier-Stokes equations,
  systems of conservation laws with convex entropy, etc...)
  can be often reduced to a convex minimization problem that can be seen as
  a generalized optimal transport problem involving matrix-valued density
  fields. The time boundary conditions enjoy a backward-forward structure
  of "ballistic" type, just as in mean-field game theory.
